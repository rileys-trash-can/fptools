# lipFP

This is LipFP, a set of fingerprint utilities. To be honest, I'm not entirely sure if it's for a fingerprint interprinter language or an intermec printer language, and I don't care anymore. So, I'm referring to it as "fingerprint" because that's what the screen of the printer says xD

If you can help me out here, please do so. (dunno if i can be helped tho)

Use [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rileys-trash-can/libfp) for documentation.

Usage / dokumentation `go install github.com/rileys-trash-can/libfp/cmd/fputils` to install.

Some of its capabilities include printing PNG/GIF/BMP images with a grayscale color model directly (printprbuf) or any other model by converting to RLL (printimg).

- `convert in.png -colormodel Gray out.png`

For the run-length-encoding based PRBUF image format, see `/prbuf`.
